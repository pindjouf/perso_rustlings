# Personal Rustlings ü¶Ä‚ù§Ô∏è

This project is done in the same style as rustlings which states that it's sole purpose is to get you used to reading and writing Rust code. This will be focusing on building the necessary skills to rebuild [kof](https://github.com/pindjouf/kof) in rust, and developing an MVP for it in ~9 days.

## Short Rust CLI Course Outline

- [x] **1. Basic File I/O Project -- [cw](https://github.com/pindjouf/perso_rustlings/tree/master/1.cw)**

    **Goal:** Write a program that reads from a text file and counts the number of lines, words, and characters in it (similar to the wc command in Unix).\
    **What You'll Learn:** File handling, string manipulation, and iterators in Rust.

- [x] **2. CLI Argument Parsing with Clap -- [cw](https://github.com/pindjouf/perso_rustlings/tree/master/1.cw)**

    **Goal:** Extend the basic file I/O project to accept command-line arguments for the file path and an optional flag --words to print only the word count.\
    **What You'll Learn:** Working with the clap crate for parsing CLI arguments, structuring CLI programs, and handling optional arguments.

- [ ] **3. Basic Note-Taking CLI**

    **Goal:** Build a simple note-taking app that creates and appends notes to a file.\
    The app should allow you to:
    - Add a note
    - List all notes
    - Search for notes by keyword\
    **What You'll Learn:** Working with file creation, appending data to files, and filtering content based on user input (which will help with searching in Kof).

- [ ] **4. Version Control Simulation**

    **Goal:** Simulate a mini version control system. Create a CLI that:
    - Initializes a new project by creating a directory
    - Tracks changes in text files (simulating commits)
    - Lists commit history
    - Shows differences between file versions (basic diff)\
    **What You'll Learn:** Managing directories and files, using structs to represent commits and files, and working with serde for serialization.

- [ ] **5. Directory Structure Management**

    **Goal:** Write a Rust program that can create, delete, and list directories and files based on user input, mirroring how Kof handles its folder structure for notes.\
    **What You'll Learn:** Using Rust‚Äôs std::fs for file and directory management, handling errors when directories or files don‚Äôt exist, and creating nested structures.

- [ ] **6. Automated Git Operations with Rust**

    **Goal:** Automate simple Git operations (like add, commit, and push) using a Rust CLI that interacts with the Git system. This can be a simple wrapper around the Git command-line tool.\
    **What You'll Learn:** Interacting with external commands using std::process::Command and automating workflows, which is key for building Kof‚Äôs note management.

- [ ] **7. Basic Synchronization**

    **Goal:** Build a Rust CLI that syncs files between two directories (local to remote). You can create a mock "server" directory for this.\
    **What You'll Learn:** Implementing file synchronization logic, handling differences between directories, and introducing networking features, which will be key for Kof‚Äôs sync functionality.

#### Timeline:

**Days 1-3:** Focus on file I/O and argument parsing with small projects like the file counter, grep clone extension, and note-taking CLI.\
**Days 4-6:** Move into version control simulation and directory structure management.\
**Days 7-9:** Focus on syncing and Git automation to prepare for the final Kof implementation.
